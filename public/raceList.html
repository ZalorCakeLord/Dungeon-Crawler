        <p>Welcome to Dungeon Crawler!</p>
        <h1>Race Descriptions (Only for flavor rn.)</h1>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Human:</strong> Ah, a Human. Known for your resilience and adaptability, but will that be enough to survive Zalor's dungeon?</li>
            <li><strong>Elf:</strong> An Elf? Your sharp senses and long life have served you well, but in this place, even the keenest eyes can be deceived.</li>
            <li><strong>Dwarf:</strong> A Dwarf, sturdy and strong. The dark corridors may remind you of your ancestral halls, but don't get too comfortable here.</li>
            <li><strong>Orc:</strong> An Orc. Fierce and unrelenting. The dungeon's twisted creatures may have met their match... or perhaps not.</li>
            <li><strong>Halfling:</strong> A Halfling! Small, yes, but with a courage that belies your stature. Be swift, and you may just slip through the cracks of danger.</li>
            <li><strong>Gnome:</strong> Ah, a clever Gnome. Your mind may be your greatest weapon here, but even intellect has its limits in these cursed halls.</li>
            <li><strong>Tiefling:</strong> A Tiefling, touched by infernal heritage. Will the darkness here embrace you as kin, or seek to snuff out your flame?</li>
            <li><strong>Dragonborn:</strong> A Dragonborn. The blood of dragons courses through your veins, but even a dragon's fire may falter in this cold abyss.</li>
            <li><strong>Aasimar:</strong> An Aasimar, touched by the divine. Light may follow you, but in Zalor's dungeon, shadows stretch long and deep.</li>
            <li><strong>Half-Orc:</strong> A Half-Orc, torn between two worlds. Your savage strength may carry you far, but brute force is not all you'll need here.</li>
            <li><strong>Dark Elf:</strong> A Dark Elf, born of the shadows. These halls may seem familiar, but even you may find the darkness... overwhelming.</li>
            <li><strong>Goblin:</strong> A Goblin? Crafty and sly. If anyone can sneak their way past danger, it's you. But can you avoid what you can't see?</li>
            <li><strong>Lizardfolk:</strong> A Lizardfolk. Cold-blooded and calculating. These damp and twisting halls might feel like home, but don’t let your guard down.</li>
            <li><strong>Tabaxi:</strong> A Tabaxi, swift and agile. The dungeon will test your reflexes, but speed alone won’t save you from everything that lurks within.</li>
            <li><strong>Warforged:</strong> A Warforged, a being of steel and magic. You are built for battle, but even machines can break in the face of this dungeon's horrors.</li>
            <li><strong>Half-Elf:</strong> A Half-Elf, torn between two worlds. You walk the line between grace and grit, but in this dungeon, you’ll need both to survive.</li>
            <li><strong>Vampire:</strong> A Vampire? The dungeon's darkness might be your ally, but beware—it also hides things far older and deadlier than you.</li>
            <li><strong>Cyborg:</strong> A Cyborg, half-machine and half-organic. Your tech may give you an edge, but can it outsmart ancient magic?</li>
            <li><strong>Android:</strong> An Android. Logic and programming will guide you, but this dungeon defies even the most advanced calculations.</li>
            <li><strong>Alien:</strong> An Alien, a stranger even among these strange halls. Your knowledge of otherworldly sciences will be put to the ultimate test here.</li>
            <li><strong>Shapeshifter:</strong> A Shapeshifter, fluid and adaptable. But will your many forms be enough to escape this ever-shifting labyrinth?</li>
            <li><strong>Undead:</strong> Undead, walking the line between life and death. This dungeon will not hesitate to drag you fully into its dark embrace.</li>
            <li><strong>Demigod:</strong> A Demigod? Even the blood of the gods may falter within Zalor’s labyrinth. Power alone won’t protect you here.</li>
            <li><strong>Fairy:</strong> A Fairy? Small and quick, but be wary. The dungeon's magic is wild and dangerous, even for a creature like you.</li>
            <li><strong>Troll:</strong> A Troll. Tough as stone and just as stubborn, but there are things down here that even your skin won’t protect you from.</li>
            <li><strong>Centaur:</strong> A Centaur, swift and strong. But even the most gallant can find themselves lost in this maze of madness.</li>
        </ul>
